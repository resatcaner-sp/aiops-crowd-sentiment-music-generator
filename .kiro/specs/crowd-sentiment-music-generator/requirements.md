# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Crowd Sentiment Music Generator is an AI-powered system designed to analyze live crowd noise from sports events and generate real-time musical compositions that reflect the emotional journey of the match. This feature aims to enhance the remote viewing experience by translating crowd emotions into musical elements, creating a more immersive and engaging atmosphere for viewers watching from home. The system will work with both live events (real-time generation) and recorded highlights (post-match processing).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Crowd Audio Analysis

**User Story:** As a sports broadcaster, I want to analyze crowd noise to determine emotional states, so that I can translate these emotions into appropriate musical compositions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio from a sports event is received THEN the system SHALL isolate crowd noise from commentary and other sounds with at least 90% accuracy.
2. WHEN crowd noise is isolated THEN the system SHALL classify the emotional state into at least 7 distinct categories (excitement, joy, tension, disappointment, anger, anticipation, neutral).
3. WHEN analyzing crowd noise THEN the system SHALL measure intensity levels on a scale of 0-100.
4. WHEN crowd emotion is classified THEN the system SHALL update this classification at least every 2 seconds.
5. IF multiple audio streams are available THEN the system SHALL be able to process and analyze them simultaneously.
6. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL maintain a latency of less than 5 seconds from crowd reaction to emotion classification.

### Requirement 2: Music Generation Engine

**User Story:** As a content producer, I want AI-generated music that accurately reflects crowd emotions, so that viewers can experience the emotional journey of the match through music.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crowd emotion is classified THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate musical compositions that match the detected emotion.
2. WHEN crowd emotion changes THEN the system SHALL create smooth musical transitions between different emotional states.
3. WHEN generating music THEN the system SHALL ensure musical coherence and avoid jarring changes.
4. WHEN a significant event occurs (goal, penalty, etc.) THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate musical accents or climaxes.
5. WHEN generating music THEN the system SHALL adapt to different cultural contexts and sport types.
6. WHEN music is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it is of broadcast quality suitable for live streaming.

### Requirement 3: Event Synchronization

**User Story:** As a broadcast technician, I want the generated music to synchronize with match events, so that musical elements align perfectly with what's happening in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a significant match event occurs THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate musical responses within 1.5 seconds.
2. WHEN processing video feeds with delay (7-15 seconds) THEN the system SHALL correctly align music with the broadcast timeline.
3. WHEN synchronizing with match events THEN the system SHALL use timestamp data from multiple sources (data API, video feed).
4. IF there is a discrepancy in timestamps THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using a defined priority hierarchy.
5. WHEN a match begins THEN the system SHALL establish a synchronization point at kick-off.
6. WHEN generating highlight music THEN the system SHALL ensure perfect alignment between music and video segments.

### Requirement 4: User Interface and Controls

**User Story:** As a broadcast producer, I want a user-friendly interface to monitor and control the music generation, so that I can ensure the output meets our quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN the user SHALL be able to view real-time visualization of crowd emotions and generated music.
2. WHEN music is being generated THEN the user SHALL be able to adjust parameters such as intensity, style, and instrumentation.
3. IF the generated music is inappropriate THEN the user SHALL be able to override it with predefined alternatives.
4. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the user SHALL see an event timeline with marked emotional points.
5. WHEN working with highlights THEN the user SHALL have access to editing tools for trimming and adjusting music.
6. WHEN music is generated THEN the user SHALL be able to export it in multiple formats for different platforms.

### Requirement 5: Integration Capabilities

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the music generator to integrate with existing broadcast systems, so that implementation requires minimal changes to current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL connect to standard broadcast audio feeds without requiring special hardware.
2. WHEN receiving match data THEN the system SHALL support standard sports data APIs (Stats Perform, Opta, etc.).
3. WHEN generating music THEN the system SHALL output audio in formats compatible with broadcast mixing consoles.
4. WHEN working with video highlights THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing video editing and production tools.
5. WHEN deployed in different regions THEN the system SHALL adapt to local technical standards and requirements.
6. IF network connectivity is limited THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully while maintaining core functionality.

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want the system to handle multiple simultaneous matches and scale efficiently, so that we can deploy it across our entire sports broadcasting network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL process multiple matches simultaneously without degradation in quality.
2. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent latency below 5 seconds.
3. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical matches based on predefined criteria.
4. WHEN deployed in the cloud THEN the system SHALL auto-scale based on demand.
5. WHEN processing historical matches THEN the system SHALL batch process efficiently without impacting live operations.
6. WHEN operating continuously THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance for at least 12 hours without requiring restarts.

### Requirement 7: Customization and Personalization

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to customize the musical experience according to my preferences, so that I can enjoy sports broadcasts in a way that suits my taste.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the system THEN viewers SHALL be able to select from at least 5 different musical intensity levels.
2. WHEN setting up preferences THEN viewers SHALL be able to choose preferred musical genres and styles.
3. IF viewers dislike musical overlay THEN they SHALL be able to disable it completely.
4. WHEN watching matches from specific teams THEN the system SHALL remember and apply team-specific musical preferences.
5. WHEN sharing highlights THEN viewers SHALL be able to customize the musical soundtrack before sharing.
6. WHEN using the system across multiple devices THEN viewer preferences SHALL synchronize across platforms.
